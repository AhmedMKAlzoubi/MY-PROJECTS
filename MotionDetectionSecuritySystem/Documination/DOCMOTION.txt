CONNECTIONS: 



ARDUINO 5V TO + IN BREADBOARD
ARDUINO GROUND TO - IN BREADBOARD

WHEN THE I2C ADAPTER VCC,GROUND,ADS,SCL PINS ARE FACING YOUR LEFT SIDE, INSERT THE 16 PINS IN THE BREADBOARD FACING YOU
THEN LINE UP THE LCD'S 16 PINS TO THE ADAPTER'S 16 PINS

I2C ADAPTER VCC TO + IN BREADBOARD
I2C ADAPTER GROUND TO - IN BREADBOARD
I2C ADAPTER SDA TO A4 IN ARDUINO
I2C ADAPTER SCL TO A5 IN ARDUINO

WHILE THE LCD IS FACING YOU LINE UP ITs PINS WITH THE I2C ADAPTER PINS

ARDUINO PIN 3 OUTPUT TO ANY Resistor valued from 200 ohm to 400 ohm -> Resistor to RED LED -> GROUND
ARDUINO PIN 4 OUTPUT TO ANY Resistor valued from 200 ohm to 400 ohm -> Resistor to Green LED -> GROUND
ARDUINO PIN 5 OUTPUT TO BUZZER -> BUZZER TO GROUND
ARDUINO PIN 5 INPUT FROM PUSH BUTTON + pulldown 10k ohm resistor to ground -> PUHS BUTTON TO +5V


LIBRARIES:

1-#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

a library for controlling 16x2 or 20x4 LCDs via I2C.

COMMANDS:

LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2); :

defines the LCD address and size 
address: 0x27
size: 16 columns by 2 rows 

to find you lcd's address run the code Named FindMYLcdAddress in your Arduino IDE then do the following steps:

Navigate to "TOOLS" Then "Serial Monitor"
a repeating text will appear at your Device's screen that either include the address or say "NO I2C DEVICE FOUND"
if thats the case, check your wiring or your components for faults

lcd.init();

lcd.print():
Prints Texts in between " ", EX: lcd.print("hello world");
or prints values directly, EX: lcd.print(SENSOR_VALUE);

lcd.setCursor():
sets the cursor at the Column and row you need
EX: lcd.setCursor(6,0):  column 6 row 0
EX: lcd.setCursor(6,1):  column 6 row 1

NOTE:
Range: lcd.setCursor(0,0) - lcd.setCursor(16,1)
 
lcd.clear():
Clears everything Written on the lcd

lcd.backlight():
turns on the backlight

------------------------------

Alternative to digitalWrite(BUZZERPIN,LOW/HIGH);

YOU COULD USE THE BUILT IN FUNCTION:

tone(pin, frequane, duration in ms);
and
noTone(pin);
