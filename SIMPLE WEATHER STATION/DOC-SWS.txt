CONNECTIONS: 


ARDUINO 5V TO + IN BREADBOARD
ARDUINO GROUND TO - IN BREADBOARD

DHT11 VCC TO + IN BREADBOARD 
DHT11 GROUND TO - IN BREADBOARD 
DHT11 DATA TO a DIGITAL PIN OF YOUR CHOICE IN ARDUINO ( DIGITAL PIN 2 IN MY CASE)

ADD A PULL 5K UP RESISTOR IN BETWEEN THE DATA PIN IN THE DHT11 AND THE ARDUINO (IF YOUR WIRE IS LESS THAN 20 METERS) AS PER DATASHEET

WHEN THE I2C ADAPTER VCC,GROUND,ADS,SCL PINS ARE FACING YOUR LEFT SIDE, INSERT THE 16 PINS IN THE BREADBOARD FACING YOU
THEN LINE UP THE LCD'S 16 PINS TO THE ADAPTER'S 16 PINS

I2C ADAPTER VCC TO + IN BREADBOARD
I2C ADAPTER GROUND TO - IN BREADBOARD
I2C ADAPTER ADS TO A4 IN ARDUINO
I2C ADAPTER SCL TO A5 IN ARDUINO

WHILE THE LCD IS FACING YOU LINE UP ITs PINS WITH THE I2C ADAPTER PINS


CONNECT THE RAIN SENSOR TWO PINS TO THE MH-SENSOR-SERIES (ADC) TWO PINS (THERE IS NO POLARITY TO THEM)
THEN CONNECT THE 4PINS OF THE MH-SENSOR-SERIES (ADC) :
VCC TO + IN THE BREADBOARD
GND TO - IN THE BREADBOARD 
AO TO A0 IN THE ARDUINO 



LIBRARIES:

1-#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

a library for controlling 16x2 or 20x4 LCDs via I2C.

COMMANDS:

LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2); :

defines the LCD address and size 
address: 0x27
size: 16 columns by 2 rows 

to find you lcd's address run the code Named FindMYLcdAddress in your Arduino IDE then do the following steps:

Navigate to "TOOLS" Then "Serial Monitor"
a repeating text will appear at your Device's screen that either include the address or say "NO I2C DEVICE FOUND"
if thats the case, check your wiring or your components for faults

lcd.init();

lcd.print():
Prints Texts in between " ", EX: lcd.print("hello world");
or prints values directly, EX: lcd.print(SENSOR_VALUE);

lcd.setCursor():
sets the cursor at the Column and row you need
EX: lcd.setCursor(6,0):  column 6 row 0
EX: lcd.setCursor(6,1):  column 6 row 1

NOTE:
Range: lcd.setCursor(0,0) - lcd.setCursor(16,1)
 
lcd.clear():
Clears everything Written on the lcd

lcd.backlight():
turns on the backlight





2-#include "DHT.h"

Reads data from DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors.
Handles the precise timing required to communicate with the sensor (the DHT sensors are picky about timing).

COMMANDS:

DHT dht(PIN,type);


dht.begin();

dht.readTemperature();
Reads Temperature from the sensor

dht.readHumidity();
Reads Humidity from the sensor

____________________________________

float rainINprecentage = map(RAINRAWREADING, 0, 1023, 100, 0); // converts THE 10 BIT ANALOG VALUE FROM THE SENSOR TO 8BIT VALUE IN PRECENTAGE
____________________________________

The rain sensor is a resistive copper pad and its resistance decreases when water is present
When dry the analog output is near 5V and as water droplets increase the output voltage decreases
